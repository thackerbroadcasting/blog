title: 13 Service Members killed in Afghanistan
introduction: |
    A devastating attack on Thursday, August 26, 2021 outside of the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan, killed 13 U.S. service members: eleven Marines, one Navy Corpsman, and one Army Soldier. The attack was one of the deadliest days for American forces in the past decade of the 20-year war, and is criticized as one that could have been avoided had President Joe Biden not called for the disastrous timeline of the withdrawal from the region, which all military members were supporting under the name Operation Freedom's Sentinel.
